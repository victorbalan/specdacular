# Task Lifecycle + Brainstorm Pipeline — Design Spec

## Overview

Replace the current 4-column kanban (Queued/Running/Done/Failed) with a full task lifecycle that starts from raw ideas, goes through AI-powered brainstorming and spec writing, then through human review before execution.

## Task Lifecycle

```
idea → planning → review → ready → in_progress → done
                    ↑                               |
                    └── re-plan ────────────────────┘
                                                failed
```

### Statuses

| Status | Column | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `idea` | Ideas | Raw idea, one-liner. Not planned, not queued. |
| `planning` | Planning | Brainstorm pipeline running — research + spec writing |
| `review` | Review | Spec ready for human review |
| `ready` | Queued | Approved, waiting for orchestrator to pick up |
| `in_progress` | Running | Default pipeline executing |
| `done` | Done | Completed successfully |
| `failed` | Failed | Failed at any stage |

## Quick Add

Text input field at the top of the Ideas column. User types an idea and hits Enter. Creates a task with:
- `name`: the typed text
- `status`: `idea`
- `pipeline`: none (manual advancement)

On Dashboard (cross-project view), the input includes a project dropdown to select which project the idea belongs to. On ProjectView, the project is implicit.

## Pipelines

### `brainstorm` pipeline

Runs when a user clicks "Plan" on an idea card. Two-stage process:

```json
{
  "name": "brainstorm",
  "stages": [
    {
      "stage": "research",
      "agent": "claude-researcher",
      "critical": true
    },
    {
      "stage": "brainstorm",
      "agent": "claude-brainstormer",
      "critical": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Stage 1: research** — The research agent explores the codebase to understand context relevant to the idea. Outputs a research summary.

**Stage 2: brainstorm** — The brainstorm agent runs the Superpowers brainstorming skill non-interactively. It uses the research output to auto-answer clarifying questions. Outputs a spec document.

After completion, the task moves to `review` status (human gate — does NOT auto-advance).

**Stage output passing:** Each stage's result summary is prepended as context to the next stage's prompt. The research agent's output becomes part of the brainstorm agent's input so it has codebase context without re-exploring.

**If the brainstorm pipeline fails:** The task moves to `failed` status. The "Retry" action on a failed task that was in the brainstorm pipeline moves it back to `idea` (not `ready`), so the user can re-trigger planning.

### `default` pipeline

Runs when a task reaches `ready` status (after human approval in review).

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "stages": [
    { "stage": "plan", "agent": "claude-planner", "critical": true },
    { "stage": "implement", "agent": "claude-implementer", "critical": true },
    { "stage": "review", "agent": "claude-reviewer", "on_fail": "retry", "max_retries": 2 }
  ]
}
```

### Agent Templates

**claude-researcher** — Explores the codebase based on the idea. Reads files, checks architecture, understands relevant patterns. Outputs structured research notes.

**claude-brainstormer** — Takes the idea + research context. Runs a non-interactive brainstorming session: considers approaches, makes design decisions, writes a spec. The spec is stored as the task's `spec` field.

**claude-planner**, **claude-implementer**, **claude-reviewer** — Unchanged from current defaults.

## Card Actions

| Column | Card Actions |
|--------|-------------|
| Ideas | **Plan** — triggers brainstorm pipeline, moves to `planning` |
| Planning | Shows live progress from brainstorm pipeline |
| Review | **Approve** — moves to `ready`. **Re-plan** — opens a text input for feedback, then moves back to `planning` with that feedback appended to the original idea |
| Queued | Auto-picked up by orchestrator |
| Running | Shows stage progress + logs |
| Done | None |
| Failed | **Retry** — moves back to `idea` if failed during brainstorm, or `ready` if failed during execution |

## Pipeline Viewer

New page accessible from sidebar navigation. Read-only view showing:

1. **Pipelines** — lists all pipeline JSON files from the templates directory. Shows file contents with formatting.
2. **Agents** — lists all agent JSON files from the templates directory. Shows file contents with formatting.

No editing — just a way to see what's configured.

## IPC Changes

New handlers:
- `create-idea(projectId, name)` — creates a task with status `idea`
- `advance-task(projectId, taskId, action)` — handles Plan, Approve, Re-plan actions
- `get-pipeline-files()` — returns pipeline template file contents
- `get-agent-files()` — returns agent template file contents

New preload channels: `create-idea`, `advance-task`, `get-pipeline-files`, `get-agent-files`

## UI Changes

### KanbanBoard
- 7 columns: Ideas, Planning, Review, Queued, Running, Done, Failed
- Quick-add text input in Ideas column header
- Action buttons on cards based on column

### TaskDetailOverlay
- Shows spec content when in Review state
- Approve / Re-plan buttons in Review state
- Shows stage progress in Planning/Running states

### Sidebar
- Add "Pipelines" navigation item between Dashboard/Projects and Settings

### App
- Route to Pipelines page

## Orchestrator Changes

The orchestrator currently only picks up `ready` tasks. This stays the same. The brainstorm pipeline is triggered explicitly by the `advance-task` IPC handler, not by the orchestrator loop.

Flow:
1. User clicks "Plan" on idea card
2. IPC handler sets status to `planning` and runs the brainstorm pipeline
3. When brainstorm completes, status moves to `review`
4. User reviews spec, clicks "Approve"
5. IPC handler sets status to `ready`
6. Orchestrator loop picks it up and runs the default pipeline
