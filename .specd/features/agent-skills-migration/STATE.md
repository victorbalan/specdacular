## Next Steps

**Abandoned.** After research and phase preparation discussion, concluded that the Vercel atomic rules pattern is a poor fit for auto-generated, project-specific codebase documentation. PATTERNS.md works well as-is for this use case. The SKILL.md command migration was also descoped as not needed currently.
