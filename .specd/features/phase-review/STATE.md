## Next Steps

**Recommended:** Discuss remaining gray areas (corrective plan numbering, STATE.md tracking, review output format).

**Options:**
- `/specd:feature:discuss phase-review` — Resolve remaining gray areas
- `/specd:feature:research phase-review` — Research review/reconciliation patterns
- `/specd:feature:plan phase-review` — Create roadmap with phase overview

---

## Session Notes

Initial discussion established the core concept: post-execution review loop that captures decisions, surfaces deviations, and generates corrective plans. Key design choice: Claude inspects automatically first, then asks user for input.
