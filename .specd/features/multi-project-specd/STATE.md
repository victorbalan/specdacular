## Session Notes

Research complete. 3 parallel agents investigated codebase integration (5 workflows analyzed), external patterns (Nx, Turborepo, GitHub Actions, Pact), and pitfalls (LLM-specific context loss, cascading failures, deadlocks). 3 new decisions from research (DEC-009 through DEC-011). Ready for roadmap creation.
