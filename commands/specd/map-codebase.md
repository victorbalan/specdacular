<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel specd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/specdacular/workflows/map-codebase.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Focus area: $ARGUMENTS (optional - if provided, tells agents to focus on specific subsystem)

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Before starting feature planning - understand the codebase first
- After major changes - refresh codebase understanding
- Anytime to update codebase documentation
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**
- First time working with a codebase (understand what exists)
- Before planning a new feature (know the landscape)
- After significant refactoring (update documentation)
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase

**Skip map-codebase for:**
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
- When you already have recent codebase docs
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel specd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Report completion
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .planning/codebase/ directory created
- [ ] All 7 codebase documents written by mapper agents
- [ ] Documents follow template structure
- [ ] Parallel agents completed without errors
</success_criteria>
