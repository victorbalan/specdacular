description: Continue feature lifecycle — picks up where you left off
---

<objective>
Smart state machine that reads current feature state and drives the entire lifecycle. One command from discussion through phase execution.

**How it works:**
1. Select feature (from argument or picker)
2. Read current state (STATE.md, config.json, CONTEXT.md, ROADMAP.md)
3. Show status summary
4. Offer the natural next step
5. Execute it (delegating to existing workflows)
6. Loop back — offer the next step or stop

**Covers the full lifecycle:**
- Discussion (gray areas, decisions)
- Research (parallel agents for patterns/pitfalls)
- Planning (roadmap with phases)
- Phase preparation (phase-specific discussion + research)
- Phase planning (detailed PLAN.md files)
- Phase execution (with progress tracking)
- Phase review (review executed work, user-guided)

**No need to remember individual commands.** This one command figures out what to do.
</objective>

<context>
Feature name: $ARGUMENTS

**Scans for features:**
@.specd/features/*/config.json

**Loads feature context (once selected):**
@.specd/features/{name}/config.json
@.specd/features/{name}/STATE.md
@.specd/features/{name}/CONTEXT.md
@.specd/features/{name}/FEATURE.md
@.specd/features/{name}/ROADMAP.md (if exists)
@.specd/features/{name}/RESEARCH.md (if exists)

**Delegates to existing workflows:**

<process>
1. **Select Feature** — From argument or scan .specd/features/*/config.json
2. **Read State** — Load config.json, STATE.md, CONTEXT.md, ROADMAP.md
3. **Show Status** — Concise summary of where things stand
4. **Determine Next** — Based on stage + phase status
5. **Offer Choice** — Next step + alternatives + "stop for now"
6. **Execute** — Delegate to appropriate workflow
7. **Loop** — Back to step 2 after each action
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Feature selected (from argument or picker)
- [ ] Current state accurately displayed
- [ ] Correct next action offered
- [ ] User can stop at any natural boundary
- [ ] Delegated to correct workflow for execution
- [ ] Looped back after completion
</success_criteria>
