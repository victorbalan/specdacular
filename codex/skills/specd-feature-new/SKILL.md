description: Initialize a new feature and start the first discussion
---

<objective>
Initialize a feature folder and start the first discussion. Creates structure, asks initial questions about what's being built, and writes technical requirements. After initialization, offers to continue discussing or stop.

**Creates:**
- `.specd/features/{name}/FEATURE.md` — Technical requirements from discussion
- `.specd/features/{name}/CONTEXT.md` — Discussion context (accumulates over time)
- `.specd/features/{name}/DECISIONS.md` — Memory file for decisions with rationale
- `.specd/features/{name}/STATE.md` — Progress tracking
- `.specd/features/{name}/config.json` — Feature configuration

**This is the entry point.** After this, continue with `/specd:feature:continue` to drive the entire lifecycle.
</objective>

<context>
Feature name: $ARGUMENTS

**Codebase context discovery:**
1. Check for `.specd/config.json` — if exists, read `codebase_docs` path
2. If no config, check for `.specd/codebase/` (default location)
3. If neither found, offer `/specd:map-codebase`

**Referenced docs (when available):**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `MAP.md` — System structure
- `CONVENTIONS.md` or `PATTERNS.md` — Code patterns
- `STRUCTURE.md` — Directory layout
</context>

<process>
1. **Validate** — Check name, check if exists
2. **Codebase Context** — Look for codebase docs (offer map-codebase if missing)
3. **First Discussion** — "What are you building?"
4. **Follow the Thread** — Collaborative, not interrogative
5. **Probe Until Clear** — What creates, what integrates with, constraints
6. **Write FEATURE.md** — Technical requirements
7. **Write CONTEXT.md** — Initial discussion state
8. **Initialize DECISIONS.md** — With any decisions made so far
9. **Initialize STATE.md** — Feature created, ready for more discussion
10. **Commit and Present Options**
</process>
